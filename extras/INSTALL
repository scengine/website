Howto install BSE
=================

Basic setup
-----------

1) Copy (or move) include/defines.php.default to include/defines.php and modify
   it accordingly to your configuration.

2) Create the right tables in your database.
   There is a SQL structure file in extras/TABLES.sql that you can import in
   your database. It contains a default administrator named 'admin' with
   the password 'password'.
   
   If you prefer to create the first administrator manually, just insert its
   name with quotes escaped (addslashes()) in the `username` field, its password
   encrypted with md5() in the `password` field, and fill the two last fields
   with a 0 (zero).

3) You may want to create some files in your media directory:
   * default/media_unknown.png that is the default icon for uploaded files if no
     thumbnail is available;
   * default/media_compressed.png that is the default icon for compressed files
     if no specific thumbnail is available.

4) You can, if you want, safely remove the extras/ directory, or not upload it
   to your server
